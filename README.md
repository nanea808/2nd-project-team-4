# Present Pear Gift Registry

## About

Present Pear is a gift registry app using Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, and Passport. Users sign up and log in to create wish lists, groups (for gift-giving events), and view and assign wish lists per group to see what items on another group member's list are still available and what have already been gifted. 

Wish list owners cannot see what items on their own lists have been marked as purchased. Group members can only see whether an item has been marked as gifted -- they cannot see who purchased the gift.

In the future, we hope to add a random choice feature allowing users to pick an item from someone else's wish list at random. We also hope to add email verifcation for new users and group invites.

## Installation

Please visit the deployed app on Heroku []() to use Present Pear.
